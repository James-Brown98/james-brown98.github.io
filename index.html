      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>
        In my 17 years I have lived back and forth between the U.K. and New Zealand. I was born in my Mum's home town in the U.K., Rotherham, South Yorkshire. It's a pretty miserable town, as it used to have all the coal mines until they were all shut down, therefore, it's not a very thriving town. When I was six years old I moved out to Christchurch, New Zealand with my family as my dad is from NZ. I've made a move between the two, three times now.

        I've been back in NZ since the end of July and so far it's good to be back, even though it's winter, the weather has actually been pretty good. My pirmary reason for coming back to NZ was to do the Dev academy. I've always had a great interest in software, without actually knowing much about it. I thought the Dev Academy would be an ideal way for me to learn and develop some skills which will undeniably be very useful.
