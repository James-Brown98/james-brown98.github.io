    <p>I see the EDA expirience as an opportunity to get
      into IT, and more importantly software, in a very
      quick fashion. Before applying for the EDA I
      went online and looked through various reviews
      and none of them had anything bad to say. In the
      fireside chat I found it really reassuring
      hearing him talk about how everyone
      on the course is kind of on the same level
      in this journey. I think this is because
      I know I'm one of the less experienced
      members of the group.

    <p>My impressions of the Dev Academy so far are
      good. To begin with I struggled with a lot
      of the work due to technical difficulties,
      however, due to a new investment in technology
      (I bought a Mac), I'm finding everything a
      lot easier. Prior to starting the course I felt very
      skeptical, as I have had very little
      experience in IT and absolutely none
      software. Since starting I've felt that
      I am more than capable of learning at this
      rate.

    <p>I feel excited to start the Bootcamp
      as it will be a great experience for me,
      because it will be my first time in
      Wellington and it will be a very different
      learning environment to school, which
      I have just left. There's obviously some
      nerves about starting especially since
      I think I'm the youngest one of the
      group, however, I still think
