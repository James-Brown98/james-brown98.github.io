                    <h3>Pleasure, purpose and passion</h3>
                    <p>
                      I think everyone would agree that these are very important features to either success and/or happiness, however, they are all really hard to work towards and achieve. Passion especially can be really difficult to develop as it's got to be something that you do actually feel is important. Pleasure is difficult also, because although this may be easier to achieve, there are a lot of really bad sources of pleasure and I think given certain circumstances it is fairly easy to get mixed up in those if you are in fact feeling unhappy in yourself. Finally, finding purpose in everything you do is also fairly hard, due to certain things that may actually be beneficial in the long run my not seem important at the time and vice versa. I think a lot of it comes down to your own perception.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Values and higher purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                      I tried to jounrnal this task and I just couldn't. I don't really have a great idea as to what my core values are. I grew up in a Christian household and although the belief isn't really with me any longer I guess I still have a lot of the same values. I think my core values have come from seeing how other people are and thinking that I don't want to be like that. I suppose I would say some of my core values would be; Respect others, don't be ignorant, don't judge, avoid hypocrisy, don't be self-righteous and try to see things from a different perspective. <br> Obvoiously, it's difficult to maintain these 100% of the time and sometimes I will slip into dropping these values, however, I still value them and find that they are very important.
