                <p>
                    Time management has always been a difficulty for me to date. I'm normally a notorious procrastinator and my attention span is usually poor. However, since starting this course I have got myself into good habits and have started off strong by getting myself
                    up in a morning and going into an office space where I have no distractions whilst I work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Observing the resources really gave me a better insight on how to effectively manage time as it's never been something I've bothered with and it has been a big downfall for me. I think the key part to it all seems to be timeboxing, and thats what I've
                    started to do myself. However, reading about the 'lizard brain' really spoke to me as that resistance is a big issue for me at times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I intend on experimenting with meditation although I don't really think it's for me, I want to give it ago and just see where it takes me.
