    <p>
      Time management has always been a
      difficulty for me to date. I'm normally
      a notorious procrastinator and my attention
      span is usually poor. However, since
      starting this course I have got
      myself into good habits and have
      started off strong by getting myself
      up in a morning and going into an
      office space where I have no distractions
      whilst I work.

      Observing the resources really gave me
      a better insight on how to effectively
      manage time as it's never been something
      I've bothered with and it has been
      a big downfall for me. I think the
      key part to it all seems to be
      timeboxing, and thats what I've
      started to do myself. However, reading
      about the 'lizard brain' really
      spoke to me as that resistance is
      a big issue for me at times.

      I intend on experimenting with meditation
      although I don't really think it's
      for me, I want to give it ago and just
      see where it takes me.
