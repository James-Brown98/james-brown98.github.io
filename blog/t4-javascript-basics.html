              <h3 class="techhead">JavaScript and HTML/CSS</h3>
              <p class="techone">First off, JavaScript is so much harder to grasp than HTML/CSS are. There appear to be a lot more rules and it's a lot more strict on the rules, for example, if you get something a little bit wrong then the whole thing won't work.
              </p>
              <h3 class="techhead">Control flow and Loops</h3>
              <p>
                Control flow is essentially the logical way of deciding an outcome in JavaScript. In real life it would be like saying IF I am tired I will go to bed, ELSE, I will stay up. Then you have loops which tell you how many times you want to test something, for example it could go until you get the outcome you want, eg. Sleep until I am tired, or they could run just as many times as you tell them to.
              </p>
              <h3 class="techhead">Arrays and Object Literals</h3>
              <p>
                The difference between the two of these is that Arrays are basically like storing a list of information which can be accessed by inputting the number of the data you want, eg. myArr[2], this will give us the 3rd item in the Array, as it starts at 0.
              </p>
              <p>
                Objects, however, can have different properties and can be accessed in two different ways. Take a Dog as your object, you can then add information on how many legs it has, what colour eyes its got and so on. This info can then be accessed either by the Dot method (dog.legs) or the bracket method dog["legs"]
              </p>
              <h3 class="techhead">Functions</h3>
              <p>
                Functions are there to make life easy. They allow us to choose the parameters that we want to use and then we can create a method with these which we can call on easily without having to enter all the information back in again. For example, we could use the parameters (a,b) and then we can get it to perform a multiplication of these two numbers. This is then easily called upon by entering the function name.
