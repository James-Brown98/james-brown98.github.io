    From the first chapter, it gave me a different perspective on paying attention. I've been known to have a pretty short attention span and can quite easily get distrated. However, making a conscious effort to be mindful is proving to be an effective tool.

    I find taking time out to meditate very difficult as I get quite restless and I just end up getting bored and then my mind just wanders. Recently, I've been using walking as my form of meditation as it just allows me to be on my own with my thoughts and getting some fresh air at the same time!
