                <p>This concept helped me stay calm whilst redesigning. This is because I've had some great difficulty trying to get my head around CSS and skeleton as I've had a lot else going on in real life this past week as well. By keeping this concept in mind it gave me peace of mind as I know that not everything is going to go perfectly at such an early stage.

                  I think meditation has a stigma that it's just for hippies or monks, and this is kind of the way I've always kind of thought. However, after hearing the benefits of meditation I really like the sound of it and I'm actually quite eager to start. I think if meditation works as effectively as it says in Search Inside Yourself then I think it could be very useful to help reduce the ever-present stress I have.
