              <p class="techone">
                When writing code having problems occur is very common. You can expect to have got something slightly wrong in each block of code when you're learning. An extremely common problem for me is incorrect syntax. I find that the best way to tackle this problem is to re-read my code each character at a time. If I still can't find the problem after looking through a few times then I usually go for a walk. I find that taking a break and going outside then coming back to my work really helps as I have a clearer mind when I get back to it and can usually spot the issue pretty quickly.

                Pseudocode is something that I can't say that I have really experimented with yet as I don't usually write things down in this way. Other techniques consist of trying somethiing, rubber ducky method, reading error messages, console.logging, googling, asking peers/coaches for help and reflection. Of these techniques I've found that the ones I've been using the most are trying something, reading error messages and googling. This is because I find them the most efficient.

                .map() - This is a method used to create a new array which returns of the old array with new changed values from a function.
              </p>
              <p>
                .filter() - This will create a new array in which all of the elements implemented return true, 'filtering' out the false ones.
              </p>
              <p>
                .reduce() - This will 'reduce' all elements in an array into a single element.
