    <p>I see the EDA expirience as an opportunity to get into IT, and more importantly software, in a very quick fashion. Before applying for the EDA I went online and looked through various reviews and none of them had anything bad to say. In the fireside
        chat I found it really reassuring hearing him talk about how everyone on the course is kind of on the same level in this journey. I think this is because I know I'm one of the less experienced members of the group.
    </p>
    <p>My impressions of the Dev Academy so far are good. To begin with I struggled with a lot of the work due to technical difficulties, however, due to a new investment in technology (I bought a Mac), I'm finding everything a lot easier. Prior to starting
        the course I felt very skeptical, as I have had very little experience in IT and absolutely none software. Since starting I've felt that I am more than capable of learning at this rate.
    </p>
    <p>I feel excited to start the Bootcamp as it will be a great experience for me, because it will be my first time in Wellington and it will be a very different learning environment to school, which I have just left. There's obviously some nerves about
        starting especially since I'm one of the youngest in the group, but the excitement kinda outweighs that.
