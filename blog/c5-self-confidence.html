                    <h2>SIY Chapter 4</h2>
                    <h3>Mindfullness and Self Awareness</h3>
                    <p>
                        The link between these is very simple, as is made very clear in chapter 4.
                        <br>
                        <br> “Self-awareness … is a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions. —Daniel Goleman
                        <br>
                        <br>   Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. —Jon Kabat-Zinn”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These two definitions tell us what self awareness and mindfulness are and when you think about them, you realise that mindfulness is self awareness.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Self Awareness Practices</h3>
                    <p>
                      I actually did both of the pracitses. The first one was the body scan and I found it to be very relaxing and it helped calm my mind and I was then able to focus a lot better. The second was journaling and this one I wasn't so sure on. I did the two, two minute sessions and it just felt like writing to me. I understand that realistically that is all that it is, but in chapter four they talk about it being highly beneficial, (which it probably is) but I didn't feel like it did anything for me.
                    </p>
                    <h3>"My Emotions are Not Me"</h3>
                    <p>
                      I found this segment very insightful, because although I've never realised it and had it have not been pointed out to me then I would never have noticed how much I fall into this trap. I wouldn't describe myself as an emotional person as such, but emotion is a big determiner as to what I'm like to be around.
